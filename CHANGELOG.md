# Releases

## V1.0.1 — 2026-10-04

- Search, More actions, and Suggest research directions share a compact row; the toolbar stays visible below sources while scrolling.
- Stronger silver gradients and graphite edges throughout the workspace. Sources have a distinct metallic frame, clearer selected colors, concise desktop descriptions, and a visible mobile heading.
- Tip text in a rounded card matching research guidance; a stronger silver-blue background separates Source evidence from its records.
- Consistent source palettes in selectors, coverage, evidence cards, and detail badges: green PubMed, blue Ensembl, and lavender GWAS Catalog.
- V1.0.1 after AI settings; application metadata, exports, and the bundled Windows installer use version 1.0.1. Existing saved research remains compatible.
- Explore presets sit on the right of Human / Auto-detect; presets and Auto-detect share grey metallic styling. Recent stays outside the search panel, with Recent: directly below Explore:. The taller query input has a thin green line that thickens on hover/focus without shifting the layout. Suggest research directions and verified AI status share an orange-grey palette with dark readable text.
- AI-generated guidance, tips, explanations, and proposed questions use a softer orange-grey surface, including AI-assisted brief editing, saved briefs, and comparisons. Saved AI-assisted briefs have an explicit label; the introduction explains that orange backgrounds indicate AI suggestions.
- The Windows workflow verifies fresh installation and upgrading the published V1.0 installer, including settings preservation and current UI/version checks.

## Windows installer for V1.0

- Self-contained x64 Windows 10/11 installer with bundled Python/runtime dependencies, per-user installation, Start menu/desktop shortcuts, and uninstall registration.
- Browser launch and native tray Open/Quit controls; singleton instance, remembered port, and loopback-only server.
- Credentials in a separate private user folder. Updates and uninstall preserve private settings, browser research, and added user files.
- Automated Windows build and actual install/runtime/update/uninstall checks; public packages omit local keys, workspace data, and IDE files.

## V1.0 — 2026-10-04

- Compact silver, sage, blue, and lavender UI; one AI status in the header and AI settings on the right.
- Verified connection reads “AI connected to GPT-6.1 Sol · key verified.” Mobile shows a short label with full details on tap.
- Selectable sources above search remain visible while scrolling. Search is the primary action before results; Suggest research directions follows a completed search. Draft and export are under More actions.
- Source-grounded GPT-6.1 Sol guidance after completed live searches: one next step and one tip, with supporting evidence available through Why this suggestion?
- Apply a refined query, review and save a proposed question, or add the next step to a brief. Saved AI material preserves evidence, model, prompt version, and date.
- Context-based session caching, manual refresh, automatic-guidance setting, cancellation, stale-response protection, and labeled fallbacks. Saved research survives AI failures.
- GitHub Pages browser demo and local Python application; key setup remains local. AI and GWAS Catalog require the Python version.
