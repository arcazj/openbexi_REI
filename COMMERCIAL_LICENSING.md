# Commercial Use and Licensing

Checked against official sources on October 4, 2026. The first version's installed Python dependencies, versions, and preserved notices are recorded in [third-party notices](THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md). Recheck the inventory when dependencies or data sources change.

## Project license

The license for original project code and documentation is **pending owner selection**. These third-party terms do not license the project itself. Add a project `LICENSE` after choosing proprietary commercial terms or an open-source license that permits commercial use.

## Software dependencies

| Component | License | Commercial-use conditions |
|---|---|---|
| [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/blob/dev/LICENSE) | MIT | Commercial use and distribution permitted. Retain copyright and permission notices in copies or substantial portions. |
| [FastAPI](https://github.com/fastapi/fastapi/blob/master/LICENSE) | MIT | Commercial use and distribution permitted, with the same notice requirements. |
| [OpenAI Python SDK](https://github.com/openai/openai-python/blob/main/LICENSE) | Apache-2.0 | Commercial use permitted. Redistribution requires the license, applicable retained notices, notices of modified files, and applicable `NOTICE` attributions if supplied. |

Three.js is deferred and is not bundled in this release. The full Python runtime inventory and license texts are linked from `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`; retain applicable notices when distributing dependencies. Transitive dependencies include MPL-2.0 code: follow its source-availability and notice requirements when redistributing those libraries or modifications, as explained in [Mozilla's MPL FAQ](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/FAQ/). Review any additional fonts, icons, assets, and sample data before distribution.

## Hosted OpenAI API

The SDK license covers client software. Hosted API access is governed separately by the applicable [OpenAI Services Agreement](https://openai.com/policies/services-agreement/), [Service Terms](https://openai.com/policies/service-terms/), and [Usage Policies](https://openai.com/policies/usage-policies/). The Services Agreement permits API integration into customer applications offered to end users; applicable usage charges still apply.

## Implemented data sources

| Source | Reuse terms and conditions |
|---|---|
| [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org/info/about/legal/disclaimer.html) | Ensembl-generated data is unrestricted. Third-party data can have separate constraints; check the underlying source and retain attribution. |
| [GWAS Catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/docs/about/) | Curated catalog data follows [EMBL-EBI Terms of Use](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/about/terms-of-use/), including original data-owner rights and attribution expectations. Summary statistics generally use CC0; verify each study's terms. Do not apply CC0 to all catalog content. |
| [PubMed / NLM](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/databases/download.html) | Publicly accessible downloads do not require a signed license. Acknowledge NLM, avoid implying endorsement, and maintain current redistributed records or disclose staleness. Abstracts can be copyrighted; access does not grant blanket commercial reuse rights. |

Full-text publication rights are separate. If adding [PMC Open Access content](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/openftlist/), check each article's license: some terms restrict commercial reuse, and retrieval must use permitted services.

## Future integrations

- **UCSC:** Commercial use of the public website/API does not require a license. Check individual track and assembly restrictions. Certain locally installed Genome Browser, BLAT, and LiftOver software, and liftOver chain files, have separate commercial licensing requirements. See [UCSC licensing](https://genome.ucsc.edu/license/).
- **ClinVar:** NCBI places no additional restrictions on molecular-data use or distribution but cannot clear third-party intellectual-property claims. Retain attribution. See [NCBI policies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/about/policies/) and [ClinVar data-use guidance](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/docs/maintenance_use/).

## Application requirements

Expose these notes through **Help → Licences** and source details. Make the [NCBI copyright and disclaimer notice](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/home/about/policies/) evident in source details and Help for PubMed and other NCBI integrations. Retain attribution and applicable terms in exports. Verify permissions for caching, AI processing, display, and redistribution for the content actually used. Recheck terms for the final dependency versions and datasets before commercial distribution.
